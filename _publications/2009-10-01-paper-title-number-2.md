excerpt: 'Recommender systems have been widely used to predict users’ interests and filter information from a large number
of candidate items. However, accurately capturing the interests
of users having limited interactions with a system remains
a long-lasting challenge. Furthermore, existing recommender
systems primarily focus on predicting user preferences without
quantifying the prediction uncertainty. Uncertainty can help to
quantify the model confidence when making a recommendation
where low model confidence could serve as a more accurate
indicator of a user’s cold-start level than simply using the number
of interactions. We present a novel recommendation model that
seamlessly integrates a meta-learning module with an evidential
learning approach. The former module generalizes meta knowledge to tackle cold-start recommendations by exploiting fast
adaptation. The latter quantifies both aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without performing expensive posterior inference.
Evidential learning achieves this by placing evidential priors and
treating the output of the meta-learning module as evidencebased pseudo counts and learns a function to directly predict the
evidence of a target interaction. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets justify that our proposed model captures the uncertainty
of users and demonstrates its superior performance over the
state-of-the-art recommendation models.'
