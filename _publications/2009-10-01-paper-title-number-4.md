excerpt: 'Emotions are an integral part of human nature.
Emotion awareness is critical to any form of interpersonal
communication and collaboration, including these in the software
development process. Recently, the SE community starts having
growing interests in emotion awareness in software development.
While researchers have accomplished many valuable results,
most extant research ignores the dynamic nature of emotion.
To investigate the emotion dynamics, SE community needs an
effective approach to capture and model emotion dynamics rather
than focuses on extracting isolated emotion states. In this paper,
we proposed such an approach–EMOD. EMOD is able to automatically collect project teams’ communication records, identify
the emotions and their intensities in them, model the emotion
dynamics into time series, and provide efficient data management.
We developed a prototype tool that instantiates the EMOD
approach by assembling state-of-the-art NLP, SE, and time series
techniques. We demonstrate the utility of the tool using the
IPython’s project data on GitHub and a visualization solution
built on EmoD. Thus, we demonstrate that EMOD can provide
end-to-end support for various emotion awareness research and
practices through automated data collection, modeling, storage,
analysis, and presentation.'
