I am a Ph.D student at [Machine Learning and Data-intensive Computing Lab](https://www.rit.edu/mining/) at Rochester Institute of Technology, advised by Professor [Qi Yu](https://www.rit.edu/directory/qyuvks-qi-yu).

My research focuses on [Recommender Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommender_system), a machine learning principle that leverages historical interaction information to acquire knowledge of user bahvior that effectively selects users's needed items from potentially overwhelming number of items. We mainly deal with cold-start recommendation problem where interactions are very limited to learn user's behavior.
